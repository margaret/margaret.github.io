##Hello World


Restructured the site from plain html/css/js to use the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and add a blog for posts written in markdown. If you can see this, it worked.  

Stole the boilerplate code for the blog posts from [Ronald Kwan](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rkwan/), who in turn based it on James Harding's [Blog with Flask](http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/).
