##Things I Learned This Week: July 20th 2015
Sooo it looks like I've had some inconsistencies with whether I want the date to indicate the beginning of the week or the end of the week. I'm gonna go with the Monday of the week in which things were learned. 

As always, this is all stuff as I understood it, there could be errors. 

####Mythbusters
One for the bucket-list: participate as a subject in an episode of Mythbusters! 

My friend David and I were lucky enough to be selected as volunteers for an episode that filmed this week. While I'm not allowed to post anything about the hypothesis they were testing, suffice to say it's probably the most yawn-inducing myths ever tested. Though the crew did say that due to the 100+ volunteers it's actually the most logistically complicated experiment in the history of the show. 

Despite the non-zombie, non-explosive nature of the show, the crew were all very nice and all the volunteers had great attitudes so it was a very positive experience overall. If you're a fan of the show living in the Bay Area, I'd definitely recommend participating if you get the chance. Once the episode is out I'll post some more details on the experience. 

One thing that the experience reinforced is that Mythbusters' strength is definitely more in encouraging people to follow through on their curiosity and desire to make cool shit than in designing rigorous experiments free from [participant bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_characteristics). But you know what? That's okay.

####LaVeyan Satanism
TWIL that Satanism isn't about worshiping Satan so much as it ain't about God, it's about *you*, and you should take care of yourself. None of this "turn the other cheek" business, and you aren't obligated to spend time taking care of everyone else on the planet. 

I took a look at the [basic tenets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Basic_Tenets), and except for the weird bit about magic (which from what I can tell seems similar to skeezy manipulative PUA behavior) actually make sense. And the sins all seem to be qualifications of "and do all this without being an asshole." 

I dig it. I don't see myself going to any meetups or anything, but it's interesting to consider when reflecting on my behavior and decisions. I definitely have some doormat-like tendencies (peer pressure + low self-esteem, ahoy!) and while of course people should treat everyone with respect and human decency as a default, remember that you don't owe it to the world to please everyone. And I could definitely work on things like "Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself." I think my biggest issue with the whole philosophy is that I do subscribe to the belief that we should be trying to better the world for humanity in general, which seems to be a discouraged line of thought. Humanism, then?

Edit: Lol this reads like an angsty middle school journal. 

####Tengwar
Tolkien was actually primarily a linguist, then an author. He built the LotR universe on top of [elvish languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages_%28Middle-earth%29) he created. [Tengwar](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tengwar.htm) is the script used to write the languages. The main ones are Quenya and  Sindarin. 

As cool as that would be to dive into it more, I don't really have time to study another language so I'm just learning Tengwar for [English Mode](http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general_english.htm). This can be done orthographically or phonemically. I've found it easiest to mostly transcribe orthographically, with some phonemic shortcuts, especially since there's not a direct mapping (unless you decide to make your own) to the English alphabet. I actually really like how the characters are organized into a table based on pronunciation as opposed to the arbitrary ordering of the Latin alphabet.
