## Links and Thoughts of the Week: January 3rd, 2016

Happy New Year! I decided it would probably be more conducive to developing a habit of posting regularly if I make shorter posts. So in the spirit of "done is better than perfect", here's a fresh attempt at collating some mildly interesting links I found recently. 

### Links

####The Annual Slap in the Face
Every year for the past few years I've read David Wong's excellent reality-check Cracked article [6 Harsh Truths That Will Make You a Better Person](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/). **tl;dr, nobody gives a fuck about who you are, just what you can do.** So make it so that you can do useful, interesting, entertaining, whatever things. Basically, make yourself useful to society.  

In this spirit of New Years, I have deleted Tinder, signed up for Jazz Piano classes at California Jazz Conservatory, and purchased the insanely expensive RSF membership so that I can resume participating in fencing practices. 

####Ants in Space
There's a lab at 'furd that studies ants and search algorithms. They sent some ants to the ISS and wrote [a paper](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2015.00025/full) about it. 

This lead me to wonder whether there was a defacto ant-tracking software, and it appears that the most-used full-featured software is [Antracks](http://www.antracks.org/). Of course it is closed-source and Windows-only. 

Then I did some more searching to see if anyone had made a related personal project, and lo and behold, some students from Berkeley's own physics instrumentation class had implemented a [basic tracker](https://github.com/approbatory/motion-tracker) using Python and OpenCV.  Awesome!  The code could use some refactoring, but I think it would make a good jumping-off point if I wanted to do something similar in the future.

####DIY Cloud
My friend (well, we've never actually hung out, but we interact via Facebook very occasionally) [Molly Nicholas](http://github.com/molecule) made a really cool [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Lightning-Cloud/) on how to make a cloud lamp that flashes like it has lightning.  I think I'm going to make one! I'm going to go about acquiring materials this week. I'm visiting Milpitas this weekend so I could probably steal a breadboard and some basic stuff from my Dad.... At any rate, even if I end up having to buy everything myself, it'll be way cheaper than the $3,360 for [this](http://www.richardclarkson.com/shop/cloud) well-executed but way overpriced (*but it's ART*) version.

####Creeping on People
There's a subreddit [/r/AmateurRoomPorn](http://reddit.com/amateurroomporn) (yeah... dat name) where people post photos of rooms in their homes to show off their irl interior decorating skillz. I'm obsessed. I was inspired to redecorate my room, which is still in the finishing stages of cleaning, but I'll make a post about it once it's done. 

####Development Economics
Recently discovered [Marginal Revolution](http://www.mruniversity.com), which is a learning hub a la KhanAcademy for econ courses. Seems legit? Heard about it from Dan. I'm three units deep into the Development Economics course. Very high-level intro sort of stuff, and it reminds me a lot of that Globalization course I took freshman year. 

###Thoughts

####Internet.org
Man, when I first heard about this, it seemed like a really awesome thing. Now it seems like a sketchy thing. Actually, it's definitely a sketchy thing. But short of the Gates Foundation and Alphabet merging to become Ultimate Benevolent Dictator of the Earth, how the fuck else are people in developing countries supposed to get internet? Good, uncensored internet? If Facebook hadn't extended their tentacles into India, what would have happened instead? I wonder if Zuckerberg sincerely believes he's doing a good thing, or if he is 100% just doing propaganda bullshit.

I suppose I could probably ask the good folks at [TIER](http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu/drupal/) about this, since that's what they specialize in. :\ Development Tech is really interesting and complicated. Maybe someday I'll work on something in that area. 

####Post-grad
sucks. I mean all-in-all, I can't complain, but while homework is terrible I do miss having friends and just .... *people* around all the time, and having an overbooked calendar instead of an empty one. I think it's just been extra-sad recently since everyone is out for break, but hopefully starting fencing and music classes will help. I'm really glad I don't have to worry about money now, though. 

####Modern Romance
I read Aziz Ansari's [new book](http://smile.amazon.com/Modern-Romance-Aziz-Ansari/dp/1594206279/). I expected it to be a bit more in-depth since he made a big deal about co-writing it with a sociology professor, but it wasn't too research-heavy, more just Aziz musing on the research. I did laugh out loud several times, and the book validated all my opinions on modern dating, which made me feel good. However since I did not learn anything new (I already knew pretty much all the content through a combination of the Behavioral Economics course I took senior year, personal experience, and reading about other people's experiences), I wasn't super happy with it. I don't regret reading it, though. 

**Recommend:** Yes, if you're interested in the topic. I think the advice seems useful. 

**Reread**: No. I'm selling this one. 

**Effort**: Quick read, took me 1-2 days of binge-reading during the week. It's shorter than it appears.
