      <p>I fenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_%28fencing%29">foil</a> for the UC Berkeley fencing club. I was also the secretary and webmaster (I gave the our <a href="http://fencing.berkeley.edu">website</a> a much-needed overhaul). If you have any questions about the club or <a href="https://fencing.berkeley.edu/decal.html">DeCal</a>, feel free to ask me :D</p>

      <h3>Berkeley Math Tournament</h3>
      <p>"The Berkeley Math Tournament Group hosts and organizes mathematical contests for middle and high school students. In organizing these tournaments, the team strives to encourage mathematical exploration and understanding by introducing concepts not covered in the typical pre-college curricula to students with high mathematical aptitude and interest. Each contest emphasizes collaboration between team members, while still allowing individuals to prove their own ability."</p>
      <p>I got lured in as a day volunteer one semester by promises of free food and milk tea, and I enjoyed it so much I stayed on and eventually became Head of Logistics (until I graduated). It's been challenging and fulfilling organizing such a large event, and I met a lot of awesome people.</p>

      <h3>UC Berkeley Resources</h3>
      <p>From what I know, the school is doing an overhaul of the ancient student sites (like Telebears) so I’m going to assume that there are more up-to-date places that list which official site you should use for what. That being said, here are some sites that I found helpful during my time there. Let me know if any of the links are broken. Last updated 07/07/2015.</p>
