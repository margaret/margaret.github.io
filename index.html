<h1>Margaret Sy</h1>

<p>Hello! I worked as a software engineer with a focus on developer tooling and test infrastructure through 2022 (most recently at <a href="https://databricks.com/">Databricks</a>). I'm currently exploring other paths and have worked as a production coordinator in San Francisco on fundraising galas and corporate events.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy taking ballet classes, rock climbing, and crocheting (especially at <a href="http://blacksquirrelberkeley.com/">The Black Squirrel Berkeley</a> yarn store, where I teach the Intro to Crochet class).</p>

<p>I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2015 🐻</p>
