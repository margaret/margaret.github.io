            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: August 3rd 2015</h2>
<h4>POPOS</h4>
<p>AKA <a href="http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=3339">"Privately Owned Public Open Spaces"</a> are a thing in SF. Basically, a space (courtyard, rooftop deck, etc.) is privately owned, but the owner has kindly decided to make it open to the public.  I visited the 15th floor deck of 343 Sansome which was lovely and quiet and pigeon-free. No wi-fi and no restrooms but it's a nice place to eat lunch or read.</p>

<p>The central art installation manages the impressive feat of  simultaneously looking like a penis and a vagina.</p>
<h4>Addictive games</h4>
<p>I've always been fascinated by the psychology element of making addicting computer games. The modern classic example would be <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>. I remember <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">cookie clicker</a> also having a spectacular but short run a few years back but I don't see it staying around. There are clearly some standard elements that make those little games addictive, like having large numbers for points, elements of random bonuses, and being simple to learn. In my quest to learn more about this I was kind of disappointed at how few studies there seem to have been done on this but I did find <a href="https://www.academia.edu/256033/_Addictive_Gameplay_What_Casual_Game_Designers_Can_Learn_from_Slot_Machine_Research._">a paper</a> on applying techniques used in slot machines to other games. I think it was difficult to google (even with Google scholar) since the topic I'm interested in shares keywords with gaming addiction in the sense of people playing 8 hours of LoL a day. </p>
<p>Now excuse me while I go play http://agar.io/</p>
<h4>Reflection erasure</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk"><strong><em>ENHANCE</em></strong></a></p>
<p>The computer vision ~~wizards~~ researchers at MIT developed an algorithm to automatically produce photos with pesky reflections or fences removed. The catch is that the photo is produced from a video, but that's still some pretty awesome applied math. Which to be honest I didn't take the time to fully grok but it involves edge detection (not that you asked but I once took a class taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector">John Canny</a> and no one in my study group realized how badass he was until one of us decided to use edge detection as a feature in a project: <em>"Hold the fuck up -- it's <code>skimage.feature.canny</code>??"</em>) and interpolation. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/05/429720274/obstructions-vanish-from-images-treated-with-new-software-from-mit-google">NPR article</a> with embedded video summary and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/papers/ObstructionFreePhotograpy_SIGGRAPH2015.pdf">paper</a>. </p>
<h4>Novum</h4>
<p>Quick link, but I just thought it's neat that there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum">term</a> for the thing in science fiction that makes the universe different than ours.</p>
<h4>Why our algorithm is superior</h4>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061009210531/http://www.jmlg.org/papers/laloudouana03.pdf">The results <em>clearly</em> show...</a></p>

<h4>WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totallynotrobots/comments/3gd78k/rsubredditsimulator_has_blessed_us_with_one_of/">The plot thickens</a>: /r/totallynotrobots discovers they have their own bot on /r/subredditsimulator. A robot pretending to be a human pretending to be a robot pretending to be a human. </p>
<h4>The Mathematician's Lament</h4>
<p>Finally got around to reading Paul Lockhart's <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">"A Mathematician's Lament"</a>, an essay on how primary and secondary education utterly ruin mathematics for almost everyone, and dear god that was so depressing. I have a lot to say on this so I think I'm going to try and make a full post if I have time. </p>
