            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 27th 2015</h2>
<h4>Mindfulness</h4>
<p>> "Miracle"</p>
<p>> "Meditation"</p>
<p>> "Buddhist monk"</p>
<p>Normally these are not the sorts of keywords attributed to the books and articles I like to read, but a friend (ironically, the same one who pointed me toward <a href="http://margaretsy.com/posts/Things%20I%20Learned%20This%20Week%202015-07-20/">Satanism</a>) recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Miracle-Mindfulness-Introduction-Meditation/dp/0807012394">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a> by Thich Nhat Hanh. It's essentially a compilation of letters offering practical advice, and the main idea of "mindfulness" -- focusing on one thing at a time -- seems worth considering, so I gave it a read. </p>
<p>The first example is practicing mindfulness while washing dishes. When you wash the dishes, don't think about how much you hate washing the dishes or what you're going to do at work this week. Just wash them. This comes across as a very "don't think of an elephant" sort of exercise, but I think still doable since it's not a total absence of thought, just focusing on the task at hand. Personally I get excited and stressed easily and tend to have a really active stream of consciousness. Most of the time I feel like my thoughts don't lead anywhere, and I definitely do a better and faster job when I'm really into something (that whole flow thing, I guess). So I think this will be something I'll try to practice. </p>
<p>The book also has a chapter with a range of exercises you can try to develop mindfulness, as well as a selection of other related text excerpts. If you tend to be a bit spacey or scatterbrained or freak out easily and aren't happy with this, the book is worth a read. I don't agree with every part of the philosophy, which goes as far as saying the most important thing, and the only thing, you should focus on is the present (I'm not familiar with pithy Buddhist statements -- how literally are they meant to be taken?). Obviously some planning is good, but maybe this could be incorporated by saying that when you're musing on future events or evaluating past ones, you can still focus on just that rather than jumping around. </p>
<p>You may or may not be able to find a pdf of it via your friendly local search engine. </p>
<h4>More alphabets</h4>
<p>Okay so that whole announcement about ~~Google~~ <a href="http://abc.xyz">Alphabet</a> aside, when I mentioned to a friend that I was learning the Tengwar alphabet, they pointed me to a whole bunch of other alien-looking (to English-speakers), but real alphabets that are a bit less well-known than say, Sanskrit or Thai writing. Definitely going to read up more on these! Makes me want to learn more about the whole information theory aspect and tradeoffs of using different types of scripts -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_script">constructed scripts</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system">writing systems</a> in general. </p>

<h4>Computer History Museum</h4>
<p>Despite growing up in the Bay Area, I only learned that the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> existed this week when my dad announced that he'd seen a groupon for tickets, and that we were going. It's a pretty legit museum, though definitely more of a look-don't-touch place (the Exploratorium's the way to go if you like interactive exhibits). The main section has a cool walkthrough of historical computing devices from abaci all the way up through the obligatory "THE FUTURE??!?" exhibits on AI and HCI. Some of the current rotating exhibits were on self-driving vehicles and VR. </p>
<p>It's a place best enjoyed if you have either a strong interest or higher education with computers -- heck, I majored in CS and I still walked through some of the sections (but there is really too much content to read everything in one visit). I can see little kids or willfully ignorant older folks getting pretty bored. If you can, try and catch one of the tours. Ours was given not by one of the docents, but by the volunteer manager who was a history major (...focusing on illuminated medieval manuscripts) and gave a charismatic and cohesive tour that also discussed the portrayal of computers in movies and how that reflected society's attitude towards them over the years. They also have a working model of a Babbage Analytical Engine as well as some resurrected ancient IBM computers from the 1960s which are really great for making you appreciate how insane all the tech has become.  </p>

<h4>ESRI Zipcode Tapestry</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data/ziptapestry">Ziptapestry</a> is a really neat interactive map describing the demographics that live in US zipcodes. A bit too heavyweight on the whole slick design bit -- it's slow in Firefox and completely unusable on mobile, but there's a ton of content packed in and it's a kick to read such on-point descriptions of types like yuppies, which are further broken down into categories such as "Laptops and Lattes": </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re affluent, well-educated singles and partner couples who love life in the big city and hold professional positions in business, finance, legal, computer, and entertainment. Most of us don’t own a home or a vehicle; we rent apartments close to amenities, and either work from home or walk, bike, and take public transportation to get around. We’re cultivating our nest-eggs instead of feathering our nests, investing in mutual funds and contributing to our retirement plans. Physical fitness is a priority, so we exercise regularly, pay attention to nutrition, and buy organic food at high-end grocers. Regular expenses include nice clothes, traveling, and treating ourselves to lattes at Starbucks or treatments at spas. Laptops, cell phones, and iPads are always on so we can stay connected. Leisure time is filled with visiting art galleries and museums; attending the theater, opera, and rock concerts; reading books and newspapers electronically; and going to bars and clubs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I from what I can tell, the app's target users seem to be companies deciding which locations to market to. Looks like the company behind it, esri, has a bunch of other interesting GIS <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/08/04/new-app-puts-the-world-in-your-hand/">apps</a> that are worth taking a look at.</p>
