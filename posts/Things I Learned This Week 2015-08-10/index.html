            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: August 10th 2015</h2>
<h4>Typewriters suck</h4>
<p>This is one of those things that you hear about but don't fully appreciate until you experience it yourself. Or experience the closest you can get to the real thing, anyway. </p>
<p>I learned via Engaget about a <em>real</em> typewriter simulator editor app called <a href="http://uniqcode.com/typewriter/">Overtype</a>, written by Ben Wheeler, which does not simply make cute clackety noises and charmingly offset the characters randomly by a few pixels. It runs out of ink. It's not 100% responsive. The "paper" moves. Backspace does not erase your mistake. It makes Notepad look like the technological marvel that it is. </p>
<p><img width="100%" src="http://i.imgur.com/WCS4XBy.png"/></p>
<p>...it was terrible and this was as far as I got. I actually have interfaced with a real typewriter before (a friend's roommate was really into the whole vintage aesthetic), but as the ink had not been refilled it was more of a randomly-pressing buttons to make fun sounds experience. </p>
<h4>Evil tech</h4>
<p>I really liked this <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/28/9058203/batman-v-superman-lex-luthor-tech-ceo">article</a> from The Verge which pointed out how one of the movie villain tropes of the current era is the <em>tech CEO</em>. Lex Luthor is literally Mark Zuckerberg. The antagonist in Ex Machina is a similarly modeled genius entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I'm too lazy to write a whole essay on this, but the article definitely got me thinking in the direction of "What is the place of tech in society?" "How much hubris must you have to found a startup nowadays?" "How do people out of the Silicon Valley bubble view all this? Man, they probably rarely think about this sort of thing at all."</p>
<h4>The Martian</h4>
<p>My interest in this book by Andy Weir was piqued when I heard about it on xkcd, and I ended up spending two days straight reading it after being prompted to again by a friend. If you like engineering and problem solving, you will almost certainly enjoy the novel, which is basically 300 pages of desperate engineering hacks. </p>
<p>One criticism I've read is that it doesn't get very philosophical, especially given how much downtime protagonist Mark Watney has between fixing his never-ending equipment problems. This is true, but I don't think it took away from the book, which has great action-movie style pacing. You can read through it quickly then do your own philosophizing afterwards while wondering why the hell the movie trailers are so incredibly spoilery. </p>

<h4>Laundry Hieroglyphs</h4>
<p>Do you hate when you need to do laundry but the tags only have those cryptic pictures? Well have I got an infographic for you. Brought to you by The Soap and Detergent Commission in conjunction with the FTC. I think I found this somewhere on reddit originally. </p>

<h4>DIY Particle detector</h4>
<p>So I lack conviction and almost never actually make any of these projects, but thankfully I have friends that do, and I still enjoy learning about things like you can make a motherfucking <em>particle detector</em> with <a href="http://unitednuclear.com/">easily obtainable</a> objects. There are a couple of guides out there for a few varieties -- <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/how-to-build-the-worlds-simplest-particle-detector/">here's one</a> that uses the compressed air method. </p>
