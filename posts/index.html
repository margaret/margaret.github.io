            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: August 10th 2015</h2>
<h4>Typewriters suck</h4>
<p>This is one of those things that you hear about but don't fully appreciate until you experience it yourself. Or experience the closest you can get to the real thing, anyway. </p>
<p>I learned via Engaget about a <em>real</em> typewriter simulator editor app called <a href="http://uniqcode.com/typewriter/">Overtype</a>, written by Ben Wheeler, which does not simply make cute clackety noises and charmingly offset the characters randomly by a few pixels. It runs out of ink. It's not 100% responsive. The "paper" moves. Backspace does not erase your mistake. It makes Notepad look like the technological marvel that it is. </p>
<p><img alt="I got this far" src="http://i.imgur.com/WCS4XBy.png" /></p>
<p>...it was terrible and this was as far as I got. I actually have interfaced with a real typewriter before (a friend's roommate was really into the whole vintage aesthetic), but as the ink had not been refilled it was more of a randomly-pressing buttons to make fun sounds experience. </p>
<h4>Evil tech</h4>
<p>I really liked this <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/28/9058203/batman-v-superman-lex-luthor-tech-ceo">article</a> from The Verge which pointed out how one of the movie villain tropes of the current era is the <em>tech CEO</em>. Lex Luthor is literally Mark Zuckerberg. The antagonist in Ex Machina is a similarly modeled genius entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I'm too lazy to write a whole essay on this, but the article definitely got me thinking in the direction of "What is the place of tech in society?" "How much hubris must you have to found a startup nowadays?" "How do people out of the Silicon Valley bubble view all this? Man, they probably rarely think about this sort of thing at all."</p>
<h4>The Martian</h4>
<p>My interest in this book by Andy Weir was piqued when I heard about it on xkcd, and I ended up spending two days straight reading it after being prompted to again by a friend. If you like engineering and problem solving, you will almost certainly enjoy the novel, which is basically 300 pages of desperate engineering hacks. </p>
<p>One criticism I've read is that it doesn't get very philosophical, especially given how much downtime protagonist Mark Watney has between fixing his never-ending equipment problems. This is true, but I don't think it took away from the book, which has great action-movie style pacing. You can read through it quickly then do your own philosophizing afterwards while wondering why the hell the movie trailers are so incredibly spoilery. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_martian.png" /></p>
<h4>Laundry Hieroglyphs</h4>
<p>Do you hate when you need to do laundry but the tags only have those cryptic pictures? Well have I got an infographic for you. Brought to you by The Soap and Detergent Commission in conjunction with the FTC. I think I found this somewhere on reddit originally. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/kBjkK.png" /></p>
<h4>DIY Particle detector</h4>
<p>So I lack conviction and almost never actually make any of these projects, but thankfully I have friends that do, and I still enjoy learning about things like you can make a motherfucking <em>particle detector</em> with <a href="http://unitednuclear.com/">easily obtainable</a> objects. There are a couple of guides out there for a few varieties -- <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/how-to-build-the-worlds-simplest-particle-detector/">here's one</a> that uses the compressed air method. </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: August 3rd 2015</h2>
<h4>POPOS</h4>
<p>AKA <a href="http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=3339">"Privately Owned Public Open Spaces"</a> are a thing in SF. Basically, a space (courtyard, rooftop deck, etc.) is privately owned, but the owner has kindly decided to make it open to the public.  I visited the 15th floor deck of 343 Sansome which was lovely and quiet and pigeon-free. No wi-fi and no restrooms but it's a nice place to eat lunch or read.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gaB0dSQDgAy47BtBBDIA9Q/l.jpg" />
The central art installation manages the impressive feat of  simultaneously looking like a penis and a vagina.</p>
<h4>Addictive games</h4>
<p>I've always been fascinated by the psychology element of making addicting computer games. The modern classic example would be <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>. I remember <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">cookie clicker</a> also having a spectacular but short run a few years back but I don't see it staying around. There are clearly some standard elements that make those little games addictive, like having large numbers for points, elements of random bonuses, and being simple to learn. In my quest to learn more about this I was kind of disappointed at how few studies there seem to have been done on this but I did find <a href="https://www.academia.edu/256033/_Addictive_Gameplay_What_Casual_Game_Designers_Can_Learn_from_Slot_Machine_Research._">a paper</a> on applying techniques used in slot machines to other games. I think it was difficult to google (even with Google scholar) since the topic I'm interested in shares keywords with gaming addiction in the sense of people playing 8 hours of LoL a day. </p>
<p>Now excuse me while I go play http://agar.io/</p>
<h4>Reflection erasure</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk"><strong><em>ENHANCE</em></strong></a></p>
<p>The computer vision ~~wizards~~ researchers at MIT developed an algorithm to automatically produce photos with pesky reflections or fences removed. The catch is that the photo is produced from a video, but that's still some pretty awesome applied math. Which to be honest I didn't take the time to fully grok but it involves edge detection (not that you asked but I once took a class taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector">John Canny</a> and no one in my study group realized how badass he was until one of us decided to use edge detection as a feature in a project: <em>"Hold the fuck up -- it's <code>skimage.feature.canny</code>??"</em>) and interpolation. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/05/429720274/obstructions-vanish-from-images-treated-with-new-software-from-mit-google">NPR article</a> with embedded video summary and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/papers/ObstructionFreePhotograpy_SIGGRAPH2015.pdf">paper</a>. </p>
<h4>Novum</h4>
<p>Quick link, but I just thought it's neat that there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum">term</a> for the thing in science fiction that makes the universe different than ours.</p>
<h4>Why our algorithm is superior</h4>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061009210531/http://www.jmlg.org/papers/laloudouana03.pdf">The results <em>clearly</em> show...</a></p>
<p>See also: <a href="http://oneweirdkerneltrick.com/">One Weird Kernel Trick</a></p>
<h4>WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totallynotrobots/comments/3gd78k/rsubredditsimulator_has_blessed_us_with_one_of/">The plot thickens</a>: /r/totallynotrobots discovers they have their own bot on /r/subredditsimulator. A robot pretending to be a human pretending to be a robot pretending to be a human. </p>
<h4>The Mathematician's Lament</h4>
<p>Finally got around to reading Paul Lockhart's <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">"A Mathematician's Lament"</a>, an essay on how primary and secondary education utterly ruin mathematics for almost everyone, and dear god that was so depressing. I have a lot to say on this so I think I'm going to try and make a full post if I have time. </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 27th 2015</h2>
<h4>Mindfulness</h4>
<p>> "Miracle"</p>
<p>> "Meditation"</p>
<p>> "Buddhist monk"</p>
<p>Normally these are not the sorts of keywords attributed to the books and articles I like to read, but a friend (ironically, the same one who pointed me toward <a href="http://margaretsy.com/posts/Things%20I%20Learned%20This%20Week%202015-07-20/">Satanism</a>) recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Miracle-Mindfulness-Introduction-Meditation/dp/0807012394">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a> by Thich Nhat Hanh. It's essentially a compilation of letters offering practical advice, and the main idea of "mindfulness" -- focusing on one thing at a time -- seems worth considering, so I gave it a read. </p>
<p>The first example is practicing mindfulness while washing dishes. When you wash the dishes, don't think about how much you hate washing the dishes or what you're going to do at work this week. Just wash them. This comes across as a very "don't think of an elephant" sort of exercise, but I think still doable since it's not a total absence of thought, just focusing on the task at hand. Personally I get excited and stressed easily and tend to have a really active stream of consciousness. Most of the time I feel like my thoughts don't lead anywhere, and I definitely do a better and faster job when I'm really into something (that whole flow thing, I guess). So I think this will be something I'll try to practice. </p>
<p>The book also has a chapter with a range of exercises you can try to develop mindfulness, as well as a selection of other related text excerpts. If you tend to be a bit spacey or scatterbrained or freak out easily and aren't happy with this, the book is worth a read. I don't agree with every part of the philosophy, which goes as far as saying the most important thing, and the only thing, you should focus on is the present (I'm not familiar with pithy Buddhist statements -- how literally are they meant to be taken?). Obviously some planning is good, but maybe this could be incorporated by saying that when you're musing on future events or evaluating past ones, you can still focus on just that rather than jumping around. </p>
<p>You may or may not be able to find a pdf of it via your friendly local search engine. </p>
<h4>More alphabets</h4>
<p>Okay so that whole announcement about ~~Google~~ <a href="http://abc.xyz">Alphabet</a> aside, when I mentioned to a friend that I was learning the Tengwar alphabet, they pointed me to a whole bunch of other alien-looking (to English-speakers), but real alphabets that are a bit less well-known than say, Sanskrit or Thai writing. Definitely going to read up more on these! Makes me want to learn more about the whole information theory aspect and tradeoffs of using different types of scripts -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_script">constructed scripts</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system">writing systems</a> in general. </p>

<h4>Computer History Museum</h4>
<p>Despite growing up in the Bay Area, I only learned that the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> existed this week when my dad announced that he'd seen a groupon for tickets, and that we were going. It's a pretty legit museum, though definitely more of a look-don't-touch place (the Exploratorium's the way to go if you like interactive exhibits). The main section has a cool walkthrough of historical computing devices from abaci all the way up through the obligatory "THE FUTURE??!?" exhibits on AI and HCI. Some of the current rotating exhibits were on self-driving vehicles and VR. </p>
<p>It's a place best enjoyed if you have either a strong interest or higher education with computers -- heck, I majored in CS and I still walked through some of the sections (but there is really too much content to read everything in one visit). I can see little kids or willfully ignorant older folks getting pretty bored. If you can, try and catch one of the tours. Ours was given not by one of the docents, but by the volunteer manager who was a history major (...focusing on illuminated medieval manuscripts) and gave a charismatic and cohesive tour that also discussed the portrayal of computers in movies and how that reflected society's attitude towards them over the years. They also have a working model of a Babbage Analytical Engine as well as some resurrected ancient IBM computers from the 1960s which are really great for making you appreciate how insane all the tech has become.  </p>

<h4>ESRI Zipcode Tapestry</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data/ziptapestry">Ziptapestry</a> is a really neat interactive map describing the demographics that live in US zipcodes. A bit too heavyweight on the whole slick design bit -- it's slow in Firefox and completely unusable on mobile, but there's a ton of content packed in and it's a kick to read such on-point descriptions of types like yuppies, which are further broken down into categories such as "Laptops and Lattes": </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re affluent, well-educated singles and partner couples who love life in the big city and hold professional positions in business, finance, legal, computer, and entertainment. Most of us don’t own a home or a vehicle; we rent apartments close to amenities, and either work from home or walk, bike, and take public transportation to get around. We’re cultivating our nest-eggs instead of feathering our nests, investing in mutual funds and contributing to our retirement plans. Physical fitness is a priority, so we exercise regularly, pay attention to nutrition, and buy organic food at high-end grocers. Regular expenses include nice clothes, traveling, and treating ourselves to lattes at Starbucks or treatments at spas. Laptops, cell phones, and iPads are always on so we can stay connected. Leisure time is filled with visiting art galleries and museums; attending the theater, opera, and rock concerts; reading books and newspapers electronically; and going to bars and clubs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I from what I can tell, the app's target users seem to be companies deciding which locations to market to. Looks like the company behind it, esri, has a bunch of other interesting GIS <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/08/04/new-app-puts-the-world-in-your-hand/">apps</a> that are worth taking a look at.</p>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 20th 2015</h2>
<p>Sooo it looks like I've had some inconsistencies with whether I want the date to indicate the beginning of the week or the end of the week. I'm gonna go with the Monday of the week in which things were learned. </p>
<p>As always, this is all stuff as I understood it, there could be errors. </p>
<h4>Mythbusters</h4>
<p>One for the bucket-list: participate as a subject in an episode of Mythbusters! </p>
<p>My friend David and I were lucky enough to be selected as volunteers for an episode that filmed this week. While I'm not allowed to post anything about the hypothesis they were testing, suffice to say it's probably the most yawn-inducing myths ever tested. Though the crew did say that due to the 100+ volunteers it's actually the most logistically complicated experiment in the history of the show. </p>
<p>Despite the non-zombie, non-explosive nature of the show, the crew were all very nice and all the volunteers had great attitudes so it was a very positive experience overall. If you're a fan of the show living in the Bay Area, I'd definitely recommend participating if you get the chance. Once the episode is out I'll post some more details on the experience. </p>
<p>One thing that the experience reinforced is that Mythbusters' strength is definitely more in encouraging people to follow through on their curiosity and desire to make cool shit than in designing rigorous experiments free from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_characteristics">participant bias</a>. But you know what? That's okay.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/unscientific.png" /></p>
<h4>LaVeyan Satanism</h4>
<p>TWIL that Satanism isn't about worshiping Satan so much as it ain't about God, it's about <em>you</em>, and you should take care of yourself. None of this "turn the other cheek" business, and you aren't obligated to spend time taking care of everyone else on the planet. </p>
<p>I took a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Basic_Tenets">basic tenets</a>, and except for the weird bit about magic (which from what I can tell seems similar to skeezy manipulative PUA behavior) actually make sense. And the sins all seem to be qualifications of "and do all this without being an asshole." </p>
<p>I dig it. I don't see myself going to any meetups or anything, but it's interesting to consider when reflecting on my behavior and decisions. I definitely have some doormat-like tendencies (peer pressure + low self-esteem, ahoy!) and while of course people should treat everyone with respect and human decency as a default, remember that you don't owe it to the world to please everyone. And I could definitely work on things like "Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself." I think my biggest issue with the whole philosophy is that I do subscribe to the belief that we should be trying to better the world for humanity in general, which seems to be a discouraged line of thought. Humanism, then?</p>
<h4>Tengwar</h4>
<p>Tolkien was actually primarily a linguist, then an author. He built the LotR universe on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages_%28Middle-earth%29">elvish languages</a> he created. <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tengwar.htm">Tengwar</a> is the script used to write the languages. The main ones are Quenya and  Sindarin. </p>
<p>As cool as that would be to dive into it more, I don't really have time to study another language so I'm just learning Tengwar for <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general_english.htm">English Mode</a>. This can be done orthographically or phonemically. I've found it easiest to mostly transcribe orthographically, with some phonemic shortcuts, especially since there's not a direct mapping (unless you decide to make your own) to the English alphabet. I actually really like how the characters are organized into a table based on pronunciation as opposed to the arbitrary ordering of the Latin alphabet. </p>
<p><img alt="English Mode" src="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general_eng_orth_cons.gif" title="Tengwar for English" /></p>
