            <h2>Things I Learned This Week July 27th 2015</h2>
<h4>Mindfulness</h4>
<p>> "Miracle"</p>
<p>> "Meditation"</p>
<p>> "Buddhist monk"</p>
<p>Normally these are not the sorts of keywords attributed to the books and articles I like to read, but a friend (ironically, the same one who pointed me toward <a href="http://margaretsy.com/posts/Things%20I%20Learned%20This%20Week%202015-07-20/">Satanism</a>) recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Miracle-Mindfulness-Introduction-Meditation/dp/0807012394">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a> by Thich Nhat Hanh. It's essentially a compilation of letters offering practical advice, and the main idea of "mindfulness" -- focusing on one thing at a time -- seems worth considering, so I gave it a read. </p>
<p>The first example is practicing mindfulness while washing dishes. When you wash the dishes, don't think about how much you hate washing the dishes or what you're going to do at work this week. Just wash them. This comes across as a very "don't think of an elephant" sort of exercise, but I think still doable since it's not a total absence of thought, just focusing on the task at hand. Personally I get excited and stressed easily and tend to have a really active stream of consciousness. Most of the time I feel like my thoughts don't lead anywhere, and I definitely do a better and faster job when I'm really into something (that whole flow thing, I guess). So I think this will be something I'll try to practice. </p>
<p>The book also has a chapter with a range of exercises you can try to develop mindfulness, as well as a selection of other related text excerpts. If you tend to be a bit spacey or scatterbrained or freak out easily and aren't happy with this, the book is worth a read. I don't agree with every part of the philosophy, which goes as far as saying the most important thing, and the only thing, you should focus on is the present (I'm not familiar with pithy Buddhist statements -- how literally are they meant to be taken?). Obviously some planning is good, but maybe this could be incorporated by saying that when you're musing on future events or evaluating past ones, you can still focus on just that rather than jumping around. </p>
<p>You may or may not be able to find a pdf of it via your friendly local search engine. </p>
<h4>More alphabets</h4>
<p>Okay so that whole announcement about ~~Google~~ <a href="http://abc.xyz">Alphabet</a> aside, when I mentioned to a friend that I was learning the Tengwar alphabet, they pointed me to a whole bunch of other alien-looking (to English-speakers), but real alphabets that are a bit less well-known than say, Sanskrit or Thai writing. Definitely going to read up more on these! Makes me want to learn more about the whole information theory aspect and tradeoffs of using different types of scripts -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_script">constructed scripts</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system">writing systems</a> in general. </p>

<h4>Computer History Museum</h4>
<p>Despite growing up in the Bay Area, I only learned that the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> existed this week when my dad announced that he'd seen a groupon for tickets, and that we were going. It's a pretty legit museum, though definitely more of a look-don't-touch place (the Exploratorium's the way to go if you like interactive exhibits). The main section has a cool walkthrough of historical computing devices from abaci all the way up through the obligatory "THE FUTURE??!?" exhibits on AI and HCI. Some of the current rotating exhibits were on self-driving vehicles and VR. </p>
<p>It's a place best enjoyed if you have either a strong interest or higher education with computers -- heck, I majored in CS and I still walked through some of the sections (but there is really too much content to read everything in one visit). I can see little kids or willfully ignorant older folks getting pretty bored. If you can, try and catch one of the tours. Ours was given not by one of the docents, but by the volunteer manager who was a history major (...focusing on illuminated medieval manuscripts) and gave a charismatic and cohesive tour that also discussed the portrayal of computers in movies and how that reflected society's attitude towards them over the years. They also have a working model of a Babbage Analytical Engine as well as some resurrected ancient IBM computers from the 1960s which are really great for making you appreciate how insane all the tech has become.  </p>

<h4>ESRI Zipcode Tapestry</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data/ziptapestry">Ziptapestry</a> is a really neat interactive map describing the demographics that live in US zipcodes. A bit too heavyweight on the whole slick design bit -- it's slow in Firefox and completely unusable on mobile, but there's a ton of content packed in and it's a kick to read such on-point descriptions of types like yuppies, which are further broken down into categories such as "Laptops and Lattes": </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re affluent, well-educated singles and partner couples who love life in the big city and hold professional positions in business, finance, legal, computer, and entertainment. Most of us don’t own a home or a vehicle; we rent apartments close to amenities, and either work from home or walk, bike, and take public transportation to get around. We’re cultivating our nest-eggs instead of feathering our nests, investing in mutual funds and contributing to our retirement plans. Physical fitness is a priority, so we exercise regularly, pay attention to nutrition, and buy organic food at high-end grocers. Regular expenses include nice clothes, traveling, and treating ourselves to lattes at Starbucks or treatments at spas. Laptops, cell phones, and iPads are always on so we can stay connected. Leisure time is filled with visiting art galleries and museums; attending the theater, opera, and rock concerts; reading books and newspapers electronically; and going to bars and clubs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I from what I can tell, the app's target users seem to be companies deciding which locations to market to. Looks like the company behind it, esri, has a bunch of other interesting GIS <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/08/04/new-app-puts-the-world-in-your-hand/">apps</a> that are worth taking a look at.</p>

            Things I Learned This Week - July 27th 2015
        </a><small>2015-08-10 15:59</small></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 20th 2015</h2>
<p>Sooo it looks like I've had some inconsistencies with whether I want the date to indicate the beginning of the week or the end of the week. I'm gonna go with the Monday of the week in which things were learned. </p>
<p>As always, this is all stuff as I understood it, there could be errors. </p>
<h4>Mythbusters</h4>
<p>One for the bucket-list: participate as a subject in an episode of Mythbusters! </p>
<p>My friend David and I were lucky enough to be selected as volunteers for an episode that filmed this week. While I'm not allowed to post anything about the hypothesis they were testing, suffice to say it's probably the most yawn-inducing myths ever tested. Though the crew did say that due to the 100+ volunteers it's actually the most logistically complicated experiment in the history of the show. </p>
<p>Despite the non-zombie, non-explosive nature of the show, the crew were all very nice and all the volunteers had great attitudes so it was a very positive experience overall. If you're a fan of the show living in the Bay Area, I'd definitely recommend participating if you get the chance. Once the episode is out I'll post some more details on the experience. </p>
<p>One thing that the experience reinforced is that Mythbusters' strength is definitely more in encouraging people to follow through on their curiosity and desire to make cool shit than in designing rigorous experiments free from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_characteristics">participant bias</a>. But you know what? That's okay.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/unscientific.png" /></p>
<h4>LaVeyan Satanism</h4>
<p>TWIL that Satanism isn't about worshiping Satan so much as it ain't about God, it's about <em>you</em>, and you should take care of yourself. None of this "turn the other cheek" business, and you aren't obligated to spend time taking care of everyone else on the planet. </p>
<p>I took a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Basic_Tenets">basic tenets</a>, and except for the weird bit about magic (which from what I can tell seems similar to skeezy manipulative PUA behavior) actually make sense. And the sins all seem to be qualifications of "and do all this without being an asshole." </p>
<p>I dig it. I don't see myself going to any meetups or anything, but it's interesting to consider when reflecting on my behavior and decisions. I definitely have some doormat-like tendencies (peer pressure + low self-esteem, ahoy!) and while of course people should treat everyone with respect and human decency as a default, remember that you don't owe it to the world to please everyone. And I could definitely work on things like "Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself." I think my biggest issue with the whole philosophy is that I do subscribe to the belief that we should be trying to better the world for humanity in general, which seems to be a discouraged line of thought. Humanism, then?</p>
<h4>Tengwar</h4>
<p>Tolkien was actually primarily a linguist, then an author. He built the LotR universe on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages_%28Middle-earth%29">elvish languages</a> he created. <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tengwar.htm">Tengwar</a> is the script used to write the languages. The main ones are Quenya and  Sindarin. </p>
<p>As cool as that would be to dive into it more, I don't really have time to study another language so I'm just learning Tengwar for <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general_english.htm">English Mode</a>. This can be done orthographically or phonemically. I've found it easiest to mostly transcribe orthographically, with some phonemic shortcuts, especially since there's not a direct mapping (unless you decide to make your own) to the English alphabet. I actually really like how the characters are organized into a table based on pronunciation as opposed to the arbitrary ordering of the Latin alphabet. </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 12th 2015</h2>
<p>To the surprise of absolutely no one, I managed to miss about three weeks of posts. Maybe I should actually just do a link dump instead of trying to summarize things. Anyway, here are some links from July. </p>
<h4>Gorskii Colorization</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Prokudin-Gorsky#Photography_technique">Sergey Prokudin-Gorskii</a> was an early 20th-century photographer, whose claim to fame was basically doing color photography <em>before there was even a way to produce color photos</em>. Getting color information only via black and white photography involves taking the same photo three times, once with a red, green, or blue filter in order to capture each of the color channels. These were recombined by projecting them through colored filters, but now it seems to be a standard intro homework for computer vision courses to reproduce the color images by aligning the plates and applying appropriate corrective filters. </p>
<p><img alt="Three channels" src="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa14/hw/proj1/proj1_files/image001.jpg" /></p>
<h4>Terrible Decisions</h4>
<p>Sometimes you want an answer on a scale of 1 to 5, sometimes on a scale of 1 to 10. Sometimes, you want to know "on a scale of 1 to Kodak not getting into digital photography, how bad of an idea is this?" Some answers I got were:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_ME#Reception">"WindowsME"</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar">"Atari Jaguar"</a></p>
<p>The thing in question was not done. </p>
<h4>Fossil Fuels and Post-apocalyptic Rebuilding</h4>
<p><a href="http://alexmennen.com/">Alex</a> shared an interesting <a href="aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/">article</a> that explores the idea that we would not be able to have another industrial revolution after an apocalypse, since we've used up all the easy-to-access fossil fuels. The bottleneck could actually be not having enough power to get smelting temperatures high enough to work with metals. </p>
<h4>NoSQL vs SQL</h4>
<p>Just one of those things that I never explicitly studied. I know some SQL from <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/">SQLzoo</a>, but I'm not sure why exactly one would choose NoSQL over SQL or vice versa. Main points from <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained">MongoDB</a> and this really interesting <a href="https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/amplab-s-co-creator-on-where-big-data-is-headed-and-why-spark-is-so-big-f0c0da2f7c0f">interview</a> with Professor Michael Franklin of AMPLab about the historical perspective on NoSQL. </p>
<p>Non-relational databases allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. This is particularly useful in an environment where you're constantly taking in new streams of data and the ability to be flexible is more useful than having perfectly optimized queries every time. Support for auto-sharding is also helpful with horizontal scaling.</p>
<p>Different types of non-relational databases include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document databases</strong>: docs contain key-value pairs, key-array pairs, or even nested documents.</li>
<li><strong>Graph stores</strong>: what it says on the can. Storing information as a graph data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Key-Value stores</strong>: The simplest kind. Some of these (like Redis) have support for typing.</li>
<li><strong>Wide-column Stores</strong>: (e.g. HBase and Cassandra) store data by column, and are optimized for querying large datasets. </li>
</ul>
<h4>It's gone meta!</h4>
<p>My new all-time favorite Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totallynotrobots/comments/3cmva7/i_have_discovered_a_subreddit_that_is_composed_of/">post</a>. In which /r/totallynotrobots discovers /r/subredditsimulator. </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 6th 2015</h2>
<p>I've been meaning to get a blog started for years, but didn't know what to write about. In the spirit of breadth vs. depth,  I'm going to just dump some interesting things I learned about each week, a la the weekly links on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/">slatestarcodex</a>. I think I'll probably update each post throughout the week, since I suspect if I wait til the end of the week to write things up, I'll never actually write anything up. </p>
<p>Should I have just incorporated an preexisting blogging platform into my site? Probably. But where's the fun in that? I don't really know much web dev so I'm going to take this opportunity to reinvent a few wheels. </p>
<h4>Python Decorators</h4>
<p>Ever seen Python functions immediately preceded by a little @thing ? Those are decorators. I was aware of them the semester I started learning Python, and I shamefully admit to blindly using frameworks that included them since then, but I realized that I didn’t <em>really</em> know what they did, so I decided to suck it up and Google it. </p>
<p><a href="http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/">Simeon Franklin’s article</a> gives a really nice functional explanation (that includes going over the concept of namespaces and closures) that’s worth a read. The main idea is that decorators allow you to modify existing functions. One way you could do this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write function <code>foo</code>.</li>
<li>Realize it’d be really handy to be able to have foo, but with functionality X.</li>
<li>Write a <code>wrapper</code> function that takes in a function returns that same function, but with functionality X.</li>
<li>Reassign <code>foo = wrapper(foo)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Decorators are syntactic sugar for step 4. Say you realize that it’d be great to add functionality X to arbitrary functions. Instead of manually feeding wrapper functions and reassigning them, you can simply define the wrapper function and then add <code>@wrapper</code> above any function you’d like to have its functionality. You can also do this where wrapper is a class (implement the things you want it to do in <code>self.__call__</code>) instead of a function. Learn more and see some examples on Bruce Ekel's <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240808">write-up on decorators</a>.</p>
<p>Namespaces, closures, arguments, and parameters are important concepts for understanding decorators because otherwise it gets confusing how the original functions could possibly have access to information that you might think should only exist in the local scope of the wrapper function, but the article I linked to does a good job explaining those, so I’ll leave it to them. </p>
<h4>In-browser markdown editor</h4>
<p>Found <a href="https://stackedit.io/editor">this editor</a> when I looked for markdown editors that would also do the whole dual-mode editor and WYSIWYG thing. The UI reminds me of <a href="http://sharelatex.com/">ShareLatex</a> (which is awesome, and if you ever need to type things up in LaTeX you should definitely check it out). I like it so far. It comes with integration with all the big cloud document services and lots of import/export options. It doesn't seem to support multiple people editing in-app at once, and I think it would be more helpful to have a more comprehensive toolbar instead of providing an example document that showcases all the possible markdown options, but overall nothing much to gripe about.</p>
<h4>Job hunting and self-esteem</h4>
<p>I graduated at the end of May but I'm still looking for a job. I could do a whole post about why this is the case, but that's for another time. I noticed that it's not terribly hard for me to get interviews - I've been applying to on average about five places a week since I moved back home, and I usually get about a phone screen a week. But those rarely go anywhere, and I suspect that my low self-esteem is showing and I'm talking myself into a hole. Some soft skills I'm going to consciously work on when talking to people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not ending otherwise perfectly good sentences with ". . . .and ...yeah....."</li>
<li>Not rambling.</li>
<li>Not using "just" as a qualifier. I didn't "just extend an unofficial API" for a thing, I "extended an unofficial API for a thing." </li>
</ul>
<h4>Color Displays</h4>
<p>Why do the colors get all weird when you change the vertical angle that you view your monitor from?</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mitsciwrite/2013/05/02/your-computer-screen-from-an-angle/">The answer</a>, courtesy of MITsciwrite. 
To be honest, I wasn't able to completely grok why this happens, but from what I can tell it involves something like: Your computer screen displays colors is by controlling how much red, green, or blue light is exposed from each subpixel. This is done with a mechanism sort of like window blinds that can change angles, which will increase or decrease the amount of light that gets through. This all assumes that you are viewing your screen from the front. </p>
<p>There was also an interesting explanation of gamma correction (our eyes detect brightness logarithmically, so why bother storing minute changes in brightness?), but I couldn't quite connect this with the information on angle viewing.  </p>
<p>Related: A "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">gamut</a>" is either the full color spectrum, or the subset covered by a colorspace or a physical method of representing color. </p>
<p>I think in an alternate universe where I entered college as a Cognitive Science major, I would have ended up studying something in this field. Heck, for a minute I actually contemplated shelling out for this textbook, but I think I'll just settle for googling everything in the table of contents. :( I wish I hadn't sold my textbook from the class I took on perception.</p>
<h4>Subreddit Simulator</h4>
<p>If you've been on reddit for a certain amount of time, you'll probably wonder if anyone would even notice if people just started submitting posts generated by Markov Chains because it seems like the same sort of crap just comes up over and over. Enter <a href="http://reddit.com/r/subredditsimulator">/r/subredditsimulator</a>.</p>
<h4>Goddammit Berkeley</h4>
<p>This hilarious <a href="http://goddammitberkeley.tumblr.com/">tumblr blog</a> showcases the most Berkeley parts of Berkeley. Sometimes all the hippie granola stuff gets annoying (and I say this as a liberal who follows a ~70% vegetarian diet), and I'm not a fan of playing "Human or Animal (poop)?" and "Skunk or Weed?" multiple times a day, but man, I love that city. Can't wait to move back. </p>
