            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 12th 2015</h2>
<p>To the surprise of absolutely no one, I managed to miss about three weeks of posts. Maybe I should actually just do a link dump instead of trying to summarize things. Anyway, here are some links from July. </p>
<h4>Gorskii Colorization</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Prokudin-Gorsky#Photography_technique">Sergey Prokudin-Gorskii</a> was an early 20th-century photographer, whose claim to fame was basically doing color photography <em>before there was even a way to produce color photos</em>. Getting color information only via black and white photography involves taking the same photo three times, once with a red, green, or blue filter in order to capture each of the color channels. These were recombined by projecting them through colored filters, but now it seems to be a standard intro homework for computer vision courses to reproduce the color images by aligning the plates and applying appropriate corrective filters. </p>
<h4>Terrible Decisions</h4>
<p>Sometimes you want an answer on a scale of 1 to 5, sometimes on a scale of 1 to 10. Sometimes, you want to know "on a scale of 1 to Kodak not getting into digital photography, how bad of an idea is this?" Some answers I got were:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_ME#Reception">"WindowsME"</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar">"Atari Jaguar"</a></p>
<p>The thing in question was not done. </p>
<h4>Job Hunting</h4>
<p>Well, looking back, job hunting really sucks. At this point of the month, I still didn't have any job offers and was getting really frustrated with everything. I was actually having trouble getting past initial engineering phone screens, and I suspected it might have something to do with how I was (not) selling myself. After talking to a lot of people, I decided to consciously focus on:
 - Not ending otherwise perfectly good sentences with "...and yeah." In general, also trying not to ramble.
 - Saying "I did X" instead of "I just did X." Own your projects!
 - Going in with the attitude that the interview was for deciding whether I was a good fit for the company, not me trying to prove my worth as they grill me. </p>
<h4>Fossil Fuels and Post-apocalyptic Rebuilding</h4>
<p><a href="http://alexmennen.com/">Alex</a> shared an interesting <a href="aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/">article</a> that explores the idea that we would not be able to have another industrial revolution after an apocalypse, since we've used up all the easy-to-access fossil fuels. The bottleneck could actually be not having enough power to get smelting temperatures high enough to work with metals. </p>
<h4>NoSQL vs SQL</h4>
<p>Just one of those things that I never explicitly studied. I know some SQL from <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/">SQLzoo</a>, but I'm not sure why exactly one would choose NoSQL over SQL or vice versa. Main points from <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained">MongoDB</a> and this really interesting <a href="https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/amplab-s-co-creator-on-where-big-data-is-headed-and-why-spark-is-so-big-f0c0da2f7c0f">interview</a> with Professor Michael Franklin of AMPLab about the historical perspective on NoSQL. </p>
<p>Non-relational databases allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. This is particularly useful in an environment where you're constantly taking in new streams of data and the ability to be flexible is more useful than having perfectly optimized queries every time. Support for auto-sharding is also helpful with horizontal scaling.</p>
<p>Different types of non-relational databases include:
- <strong>Document databases</strong>: docs contain key-value pairs, key-array pairs, or even nested documents.
- <strong>Graph stores</strong>: what it says on the can. Storing information as a graph data structure.
- <strong>Key-Value stores</strong>: The simplest kind. Some of these (like Redis) have support for typing.
- <strong>Wide-column Stores</strong>: (e.g. HBase and Cassandra) store data by column, and are optimized for querying large datasets. </p>
<h4>It's gone meta!</h4>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week: July 6th 2015</h2>
<p>I've been meaning to get a blog started for years, but didn't know what to write about. In the spirit of breadth vs. depth,  I'm going to just dump some interesting things I learned about each week, a la the weekly links on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/">slatestarcodex</a>. I think I'll probably update each post throughout the week, since I suspect if I wait til the end of the week to write things up, I'll never actually write anything up. </p>
<p>Should I have just incorporated an preexisting blogging platform into my site? Probably. But where's the fun in that? I don't really know much web dev so I'm going to take this opportunity to reinvent a few wheels. </p>
<h4>Python Decorators</h4>
<p>Ever seen Python functions immediately preceded by a little @thing ? Those are decorators. I was aware of them the semester I started learning Python, and I shamefully admit to blindly using frameworks that included them since then, but I realized that I didn’t <em>really</em> know what they did, so I decided to suck it up and Google it. </p>
<p><a href="http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/">Simeon Franklin’s article</a> gives a really nice functional explanation (that includes going over the concept of namespaces and closures) that’s worth a read. The main idea is that decorators allow you to modify existing functions. One way you could do this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write function <code>foo</code>.</li>
<li>Realize it’d be really handy to be able to have foo, but with functionality X.</li>
<li>Write a <code>wrapper</code> function that takes in a function returns that same function, but with functionality X.</li>
<li>Reassign <code>foo = wrapper(foo)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Decorators are syntactic sugar for step 4. Say you realize that it’d be great to add functionality X to arbitrary functions. Instead of manually feeding wrapper functions and reassigning them, you can simply define the wrapper function and then add <code>@wrapper</code> above any function you’d like to have its functionality. You can also do this where wrapper is a class (implement the things you want it to do in <code>self.__call__</code>) instead of a function. Learn more and see some examples on Bruce Ekel's <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240808">write-up on decorators</a>.</p>
<p>Namespaces, closures, arguments, and parameters are important concepts for understanding decorators because otherwise it gets confusing how the original functions could possibly have access to information that you might think should only exist in the local scope of the wrapper function, but the article I linked to does a good job explaining those, so I’ll leave it to them. </p>
<h4>In-browser markdown editor</h4>
<p>Found <a href="https://stackedit.io/editor">this editor</a> when I looked for markdown editors that would also do the whole dual-mode editor and WYSIWYG thing. The UI reminds me of <a href="http://sharelatex.com/">ShareLatex</a> (which is awesome, and if you ever need to type things up in LaTeX you should definitely check it out). I like it so far. It comes with integration with all the big cloud document services and lots of import/export options. It doesn't seem to support multiple people editing in-app at once, and I think it would be more helpful to have a more comprehensive toolbar instead of providing an example document that showcases all the possible markdown options, but overall nothing much to gripe about.</p>
<h4>Job hunting and self-esteem</h4>
<p>I graduated at the end of May but I'm still looking for a job. I could do a whole post about why this is the case, but that's for another time. I noticed that it's not terribly hard for me to get interviews - I've been applying to on average about five places a week since I moved back home, and I usually get about a phone screen a week. But those rarely go anywhere, and I suspect that my low self-esteem is showing and I'm talking myself into a hole. Some soft skills I'm going to consciously work on when talking to people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not ending otherwise perfectly good sentences with ". . . .and ...yeah....."</li>
<li>Not rambling.</li>
<li>Not using "just" as a qualifier. I didn't "just extend an unofficial API" for a thing, I "extended an unofficial API for a thing." </li>
</ul>
<h4>Color Displays</h4>
<p>Why do the colors get all weird when you change the vertical angle that you view your monitor from?</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mitsciwrite/2013/05/02/your-computer-screen-from-an-angle/">The answer</a>, courtesy of MITsciwrite. 
To be honest, I wasn't able to completely grok why this happens, but from what I can tell it involves something like: Your computer screen displays colors is by controlling how much red, green, or blue light is exposed from each subpixel. This is done with a mechanism sort of like window blinds that can change angles, which will increase or decrease the amount of light that gets through. This all assumes that you are viewing your screen from the front. </p>
<p>There was also an interesting explanation of gamma correction (our eyes detect brightness logarithmically, so why bother storing minute changes in brightness?), but I couldn't quite connect this with the information on angle viewing.  </p>
<p>Related: A "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">gamut</a>" is either the full color spectrum, or the subset covered by a colorspace or a physical method of representing color. </p>
<p>I think in an alternate universe where I entered college as a Cognitive Science major, I would have ended up studying something in this field. Heck, for a minute I actually contemplated shelling out for this textbook, but I think I'll just settle for googling everything in the table of contents. :( I wish I hadn't sold my textbook from the class I took on perception.</p>
<h4>Subreddit Simulator</h4>
<p>If you've been on reddit for a certain amount of time, you'll probably wonder if anyone would even notice if people just started submitting posts generated by Markov Chains because it seems like the same sort of crap just comes up over and over. Enter <a href="http://reddit.com/r/subredditsimulator">/r/subredditsimulator</a>.</p>
<h4>Goddammit Berkeley</h4>
<p>This hilarious <a href="http://goddammitberkeley.tumblr.com/">tumblr blog</a> showcases the most Berkeley parts of Berkeley. Sometimes all the hippie granola stuff gets annoying (and I say this as a liberal who follows a ~70% vegetarian diet), and I'm not a fan of playing "Human or Animal (poop)?" and "Skunk or Weed?" multiple times a day, but man, I love that city. Can't wait to move back. </p>

            <h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>Restructured the site from plain html/css/js to use the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask framework</a> and add a blog for posts written in markdown. If you can see this, it worked.  </p>
<p>Stole the boilerplate code for the blog posts from <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rkwan/">Ronald Kwan</a>, who in turn based it on James Harding's <a href="http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/">Blog with Flask</a>.</p>
