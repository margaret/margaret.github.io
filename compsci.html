            <h3>Analyzing Kenya's electrical grid</h3>
            <h4>Summer 2013 - Technology and Infrastructure for Emerging Regions Lab (TIER) - UC Berkeley</h4>
            <p>I worked as a research assistant to Javier Rosa and analyzed tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/kenyapower">@KenyaPower</a>, the customer service account of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, using the Twitter API and a Naive Bayes classifier to see if power outage patterns could be predicted from complaints. Rudimentary visualization was implemented using Google Fusion Tables and Google Maps APIs.</p>

            [Find appropriate overview of econ and eecs components]

            <p>[What I did. Write tweet conversation collector with API]</p>

            <h5>Outcomes / What I learned</h5>
            <p>[Insert ppt presentation here. Decided to focus on academics during the semester so left the project after this. If I were to do this again, I would have taken advantage of the Python pandas library, as in retrospect a lot of the helper functions I spent time writing have been implemented in the DataFrame class. I might redo this as hackathon project, and include proper visualization. It was also pretty cool to see how a international-scale interdisciplinary project was conducted.]</p>

            <h3>Fencing Website</h3>
            <p>Completely remade the UC Berkeley Fencing Club's website for the Fall 2014 semester. First time doing any sort of web dev (better late than never), so I decided that using Twitter Bootstrap and Wordpress would be the best way to quickly make a modern-looking and responsive site. The old website used a custom template from [find that ref], cutenews for annoucnements, and jalbum for photos. Although wordpress is a lot heavier than cutenews, it seems to be a lot better supported, and the admin interface more accessible to non-technical people. Likewise I changed the photo hosting to Flickr, which allows anyone on the team to easily upload photos, and slideshows can be easily embeded. I also uploaded the teaching videos to YouTube so that they are more accessible. Eventually I would like to turn these into gifs since most of them are only several seconds long.</p>

            <h3>Molecular Biology</h3>
            <p>Once upon a time, I was an Integrative Biology major, and decided that I should try benchwork to be more well-rounded. I worked in the Stillman Lab in Fall 2012, doing RNA purification for a project on the effect of increasing temperatures on insects in local streams. I followed a phenol-chloroform extraction protocol, which invovled a lot of micropipetting and using what was basically a miniature blender to liquefy the insect </p>
