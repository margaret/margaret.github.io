                <p>One of the assignments for <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/practice-art-w23ac-american-cybercultures-principles-internet-citizenship">a class</a> I'm currently in involved creating a portrait of someone based off of an interview.
                Here's a copy of mine:</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Please describe your personality.</h4>
                    <p>People tend to describe me as pretty serious and rational. I agree with this description.</p>
                    <p>However, I think I get excited about things easily. Example: It's surprisingly easy to convince me to take a class if you sound excited enough about it (and explain why). CS 164? That sounds amazing. English 104 Old English (language and literature) even though I've never taken a writing/English class at Berkeley? That sounds like a great idea! Sure, I'm totally down to audit MCB 160 (neuroscience for MCB majors). Wow, I should really take an upper div math class. Definitely signing up for Art 23AC, then! (I've done all of these except the upper div math class). </p>
                <br>
                <!--yeah, I probably should define a new formatting thing instead of inserting breaks-->
                <h4>What are your interests and passions?</h4>
                    <p><a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/centersandclinics/ictd">Information and Communication Technologies and Development.</a>  I freaking love the internet and technology and I find globalization fascinating, and I think that how technology spreads (how we can push this further, thinking about how it affects people, etc) is an important issue. I think we don't think about this enough in Silicon Valley. The culture is a lot more insular/self-serving than most people like to think about. I'm all for scratching your own itch (I spend a lot of time on Facebook, Snapchat, Tumblr, etc), but a huuuuge fraction of the planet doesn't have solid internet access. Or even electricity. Or water. Admittedly I have not personally done anything about this issue but I would like to eventually work on something related to this for some portion of my career (real talk though I have no idea what I'm doing after graduating this semester besides that I'm going to do something in industry hopefully maybe something data science related. I did work as a research assistant in the <a href="http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu/drupal/">TIER lab </a> for a summer, so I've walked a tiny bit of the talk. I'm currently in Info 234 (Information Technology - Economics, Strategy, and Policy) which looks to be exciting. I saw the ischool has an ICTD seminar this semester but sadly I don't think I could fully commit given the rest of my schedule. </p>
                    <p>STEM education. STEM STEM STEM glorious STEM (yes writing and networking are important skills and it's important for society to be aware of various cultural histories etc etc). Volunteer for all the outreach events! Science is fun, kids! Math is beautiful! I used to work as an assistant at the Lawrence Hall of Science's <a href="http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/services_and_expertise/research_group">education research and consulting group</a> and it was one of the more fulfilling minimum wage jobs I've had. Not that I've had many jobs, but still. Also see Berkeley Math Tournament in my answer to the extracurriculars question. </p>
                    <p><a href="misc.html">Makeup.</a> You definitely wouldn't guess it seeing me every day but lemme say, people who connect with me on <a href="http://pygoscelis.tumblr.com">social media</a> get to see some weird-ass pictures of my face. Beauty makeup is interesting and enjoyable but I do face/body painting and a bit of SFX makeup as a hobby. It's insane how much you can change how you look. I love watching Face Off and watching behind the scenes movie production clips, and this Halloween people actually paid me to do their makeup. I still find that kind of amazing.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>If you could be anywhere in the world, where would you be?</h4>
                    <p>Cheesy answer for this one: not any particular physical location, but hanging out playing board games or card games with friends is always awesome. That being said, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=death+valley&tbm=isch">Death Valley</a> has a lot of really awesome (in the original sense of the word) sites and it is my favorite National Park. And the Tokyo metropolis looks like the future and I really want to visit it someday (inb4 no, I've never actually read any manga and I can count the number of anime series I've watched on one hand).</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Favorite spot on campus?</h4>
                    <p>Solitary: VLSB ground floor atrium. Great lighting, and there are <em>dinosaurs</em> (sort of).</p>
                    <div style="text-align: left;"><img src="imgs/vlsb.jpg" style="width:500px"></div>
                    <p>With other people:
                        I often gripe about spending so much time in windowless rooms in Soda Hall, but I think I got Stockholm Syndrome because to be honest I kind of enjoy it now. I think it's a combination of the esprit de corps you get from spending hours suffering with people and just generally being productive and getting some learning on over there. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Favorite anything?</h4>
                    <p>I watched five seasons of Adventure Time over winter break, and it is my new favorite TV show. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Extracurricular activities?</h4>
                    <p>Fencing! I joined the fencing team last spring and it's my favorite decision I've made at Berkeley, after switching into Computer Science. I like like it a lot more than swimming (I used to swim in high school) because there's actually a strategy element. It feels very interactive to me, yet without the pressure of team sports where you can disappoint other people, so you can focus more on improving your own game without feeling bad. Plus it's great stress relief to stab people and I secretly enjoy having bruises all the time because it makes me feel badass despite otherwise generally being cautious/reserved. <i>Oh, that? It's from getting stabbed, nbd, really.</i> </p>
                    <p>I also help run the <a href="http://bmt.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Math Tournament</a> (math competitions for middle school and high school students - one tournament per semester). I think mathematics is amazing and CS 70 is one of my favorite classes that I've taken, but I am really. slow. at. math. I had a really hard time with the theory-heavy classes I've taken and I probably wouldn't survive upper division math. However I do love acquiring free food, and my sophomore year I helped out with the tournament as a volunteer because I didn't have anything else to do that day and they offered free breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and pearl milk tea. Turns out it was actually super fulfilling to put on a large-scale physical event (and yay, promoting recreational education), so I stayed and am now on the core (volunteer) staff.</p>
                    <p>I finally settled into those two, but in the course of my time here I have been active in (to various degrees - I was on a committee of some sort for most of these): Circle K International, Engineers Without Borders (I wish I'd stayed in this), IEEE (only for the micromouse robotics competition), AIAA Robo-Ops (I now know ever-so-slightly more than squat about robotics. Don't ask me to draw any circuit diagrams.), the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), Society of Women Engineers, Department of Integrative Biology Students, and probably two or three more that I've forgotten about. I've... tried a lot of things and may or may not have trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life.</p>
