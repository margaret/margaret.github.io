      <h3>Thoughts on College</h3>

      <p>Berkeley is an amazing university. Many departments are some of the best in their field, the location is great, and on the whole the students and faculty are passionate, hard-working, and generally awesome people. That being said I wouldn’t blanket-recommend it to everyone. It’s a huge school and it’s very easy to end up floating around by yourself. There are tons of resources to help you succeed, but it’s on you to use them. Nobody is going to hold your hand. </p>

      <p>I could talk for hours about my experiences here, but for the sake of space I think it’d be most useful to just write about things I wish I’d done differently.* That’s usually one of the top things I’m interested in when asking people about their academic or career experience. That, and “Where are the best places to eat around here?” All of this rambling is based on my time at Cal, but I think a lot of it would apply to any undergraduate experience. I don’t have any delusions that this page is going to change anyone’s life, but if having this out here helps someone, that’s great.</p>

      <p>*Obviously YMMV with everything in this entry. If you’re a Super Student and can handle taking four techs a semester, go right ahead. But a lot of people think they are, then realize in regretrospect that they aren’t. </p>


      <br>
      <h4 id="course-scheduling">Course scheduling</h4>

      <p>I think what would have made the biggest improvement in my quality of life during my undergraduate career is if I had taken fewer classes per semester, and focused on <em>really</em> understanding the material in those, as opposed to attempting to take many classes and doing poorly in them. Especially concerning core lower division classes - if you understand that material well enough that you could teach it, it makes it much easier to build on it in any of the more specialized classes. It’ll also help your sanity a lot if you have time to properly absorb everything, and also get sleep and exercise and have time to hang out with your friends. There tends to be this mentality of needing to go as hard as possible and you’re-lame-why-are-you-even-here if you don’t, but I think for most people, it’s much more helpful to focus your energy on fewer classes.</p>

      <p>This is specific to me, but as someone interested in research-y things and data science, I wish I’d taken one or two good real statistics classes (like Stats 134) in addition to CS 70 and totally owned them. I also regret not taking <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa14/">CS 194-26</a> (computational image manipulation) and databases (CS 186 - though I do know SQL I think it would have been good to learn more about database design principles). However the wonderful thing about the internet is that most of that material is online in some form or another, so I can always learn it now. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 id="studying">Studying</h4>

      <p>Unless you are <em>That Person</em> setting the curve, it’s very likely that it would help a lot in difficult classes (e.g. not a class where your grade depends only on how well you can regurgitate the slides on the midterm) if you have a dependable study group. It doesn’t have to be people smarter than you, or people you know already. But by any means available, as early as possible in the semester assemble yourself a three to five person group that is dedicated to meeting on a regular schedule. Having a support group that you can depend on will help your grade and your sanity. If your class doesn’t have its own forum (no Piazza, or the bCourses is dead), I also recommend creating a Facebook group where people can collectively ask and answer things. </p>

      <p>Also: <em>Go. To. Office. Hours.</em> If your study group has spent half an hour thinking about a problem, and nobody came up with anything helpful after having their subconscious stew on it for the rest of the day, ask the GSI for help. This is a lot more time efficient and is the method of completing assignments recommended to me by multiple course staff members. This is also why it’s a good idea to have the study group meetings spaced out during the week, and not only the same day as office hours.</p>

      <p>And if you’re gonna study in libraries, you’re not allowed to complain that there’s no space in Main Stacks because there are literally more than twenty libraries and so many of them are much better. My personal favorites are </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Engineering Library: long hours, and it’s chill and good for group work because talking is fine)  </li>
        <li>The Transportation Studies Library: basically a lounge for the TS grad students. Talking is fine, there’s a couch for naps, a ping pong table, and nobody knows about it so it’s rarely at capacity. If you don’t make it super obnoxiously obvious that you’re not a grad student, you can probably stay in past the official hours.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h4 id="finding-yourself-and-more-on-classes">Finding yourself (and more on classes)</h4>

      <p>College is supposed to be finding out what you want to do with your life, and it’s common to hear the “do what you love” advice. Fuck that. Do something that will get you a job that pays comfortably enough that you can do what you love on the weekends. Of course, if you’re really really truly passionate about something, and you think you could be happy working long hours for questionable utility (note that there’s a Cards Against Humanity card for “Being knowledgeable in a narrow domain that nobody understands or cares about”), go ahead. But before you spend two years trying to major in Ecology or Art History, take a good hard look at career prospects and think about whether you can see yourself doing this for the next few decades. </p>

      <p>That being said, definitely don’t blow off your breadth classes by taking the easiest possible class that you don’t actually care about, or only taking classes which are as close as possible to your major department. I was victim to this first semester freshman year, when I signed up essentially random breadth classes. There’s a class on nearly everything, and you might find that you’re inspired to minor in Near Eastern Studies or Mathematics because you took that class that looked interesting but oh gosh the average grade is a B, not an A- (this isn’t an Ivy, you’re not going to get a 4.0). Take classes you’re interested in! Some of the classes I liked the most were <a href="https://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu/explore/courses/SP/2015/4316">Globalization</a> (surprisingly not granola preachy), <a href="https://ninjacourses.com/explore/1/course/NE%20STUD/192B/#sections">NES 192B</a> (a seminar on motherfucking Ancient Egyptian magic and demonology - see the [note]), <a href="http://english.berkeley.edu/courses/3570">Old English</a>, <a href="https://ninjacourses.com/ratings/view/course/659/">Perception</a>, and <a href="https://ninjacourses.com/explore/1/course/LINGUIS/100/">Intro to Linguistics</a>. The bonus point is that you’re likely to do better if you like the material. Also remember that you can P/NP up to a third of your units. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 id="life-outside-of-class">Life outside of class</h4>

      <p>Yes there is such a thing. If there isn’t, you should make it a thing. In accordance to taking a not-insane courseload as discussed above, you should use that extra time by regularly hanging out at a club or organization of some sort. More friends (if you see the same group of people twice a week for a whole semester, you’re gonna have friends), and having something to think about besides your homework is nice. If possible, I recommend sticking with the same activity for longer than a semester, because then you can get better at it, and the connections you make will be stronger. I was in probably more than ten groups the four years I was in Berkeley, and as much as I value the experiences I had in all of them, I think it would have been better if I’d found and stuck to fencing, BMT, and maybe something music related for three or four years. </p>

      <p>Make time for exercise. I felt a lot better physically after I started fencing regularly even though I was taking harder classes and had work. You’ll think “Oh I don’t have time for that,” (me the first two years) but for your own sake, make time. Plus it feels good and you’ll look better. Get two for one and make one of your regular activities intramural sports or something. </p>

      <p>Also - having a social life requires work, but it’s worth it. Even if you have to be the one incessantly messaging people to coordinate the best time for game night or the SF outing or whatever, do it. I didn’t start doing this until around senior year, and I could have had so much more fun if I had figured out that I needed to put in the work instead of waiting for social opportunities to magically present themselves to me earlier. </p>


      <br>
      <h4 id="failure-its-totally-an-option">Failure (It’s totally an option)</h4>

      <p>So maybe you took a few too many classes and you fail one. Or two. Maybe more. It’s not the end of the world. While ideally this won’t happen, recognize that even if it does, it’s not the end of the world, nor does it mean you’re a failure as a person. Use it to evaluate what changes you need to make in your life so it doesn’t happen again, then make those changes. Don’t freak out and descend into a further spiral of failure by continuing to make the same mistakes. </p>

      <p>You’ll probably read this a zillion times, but going to a top school like Berkeley means that everyone who’s there was formerly the biggest fish in their metaphorical pond, but now all of those students are going to have to fit to a normal distribution. I thought that I had internalized this concept, but until I fucked up so badly one semester that I ended up on term academic probation (long story which could have been prevented had I done all the things I wrote about here), I didn’t really believe that it was okay to not be at the top of the scale, and that even if you’re getting a B- average, that doesn’t mean that you’re an incompetent failure who doesn’t deserve to be in your major. Hell, remember that half the people in your class are scoring below the median. By definition. It’s really not a big deal (unless you’re going to pursue a graduate degree… in which case, good luck). </p>

      <p>Even if you don’t think you’re clinically depressed or anything, if you’re having a hard time, definitely talk to some of your friends. Maybe even schedule a talk with a counselor. Sometimes it’s good to get some outside perspective. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 id="food">Food</h4>

      <p>I’m probably not the best person to ask about this since I don’t have much of a discriminating palate, but since I mentioned it earlier I suppose I should have a section on this. I’m basic but some places I like are </p>

      <p><strong>Sliver Pizzeria</strong> <br>
        It’s Cheeseboard, but so much closer to campus. Unlike Artichoke, I don’t hate myself after eating here. </p>

      <p><strong>Asha Tea House</strong> <br>
        I think they have the best tea. I always had trouble connecting to their wi-fi, but if you don’t it’s a good place to camp out and do some work. It’s a bit expensive though, and if you’re on campus it’s probably better in the interest of time to just go to ShareTea. </p>

      <p><strong>Imm Thai Food</strong> <br>
        It’s next to Asha, and the food is good (not super greasy, and everything has actual flavors), there’s seating, and it’s clean. </p>

      <p><strong>Heavenly Foods</strong> (Vietnamese Food Truck) <br>
        The food isn’t anything special, but if you’re around College and Bancroft (or maybe College and Telegraph once the construction is over), it’s worth checking out. Relatively cheap, and the lady who runs it is really sweet.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Well, that turned out a lot longer than I thought.</p>
