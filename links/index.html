      <li>The <a href="http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/sojourner.html">original Sojourner Rover website</a> from 1996-1997 is still up and is one of my favorite things on the internet. Some of the subpages have text and <a href="http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rovercom/rovcom.html">HIGH GRAPHICS VERSIONS</a>. It actually used a lot of commodity hardware, and I was surprised to learn the controls had a VR component.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sequin/CS39/">Berkeley seminar CS39</a> — fun intro to symmetry and topology that I took way back in my sophomore year. I guess the site itself isn't super great, but clicking around can set you off down rabbit holes of knots and symmetry and graphs.</li>

    <h3>Things I like reading</h3>
    <ul style="padding-left:10px">
      <li><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/">Wait But Why</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">Scientific American Q&A</a> with Scott Aaronson</li>
      <li>Actually, the blog <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/">blog</a> which produced that^ actually has consistently interesting posts</li>
      <li><a href="http://priceonomics.com/">Priceonomics</a> — Blog posts on a variety of topics, usually based on datasets. These seem to be written by companies trying to increase their SEO, but the article quality is usually pretty good. Often covers SF-related topics.</li>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/halting-problem">The Halting Problem</a> — The Onion, for tech. (Written by Peter Gao.) I can't tell if it's hard to tell these are satire because they're so excellently written, or because Silicon Valley really has lost its mind. Probably both.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025/">The Martian</a> — If you haven't read The Martian <span style="font-style:italic"><a href="https://xkcd.com/1536/">you need to read The Martian</a>.</span></li>

      <li><a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a> — Another heavily STEM-influenced but legitimately hillarious webcomic.</li>
      <li><a href="http://lackadaisycats.com/">Lackadaisy</a> — A jaw-droppingly painstakingly illustrated webcomic about anthropomorphized cats running a speakeasy in the 1920s. It sounds strange but it's actually great.</li>
      <li><a href="https://tapastic.com/series/fisheye">Fisheye Placebo</a> — mysteriously-named, excellently-illustrated cyberpunk-y webcomic of the internet and freedom and ethics. (Rarely updated.)</li>
