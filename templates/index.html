<h1>Margaret Sy</h1>

<p>I'm a software enginer at <a href="https://mesosphere.com">Mesosphere</a> where I write software for automating testing and releases for <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos">DCOS</a> (the Datacenter Operating System), which involves DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS and BIG DATA and CONTAINERS and CLOUD-NATIVE TECHNOLOGY and stuff.</p>

<p>Some things I like: <a href="http://berkeleyballettheater.org">ballet</a>, chinchillas, NOVA documentaries, cheese, watercolors, spaaaaace, and lists.</p>

<p>Previously at <a href="http://swiftnav.com">Swift Navigation</a> in San Francisco, where I worked on a pipeline for automated hardware-in-the-loop testing of high-accuracy GNSS sensors that go into THINGS IN SPACE and AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES and stuff.</p>

<p>Proud owner of a BA in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I spent four years meandering through a series of research assistant positions in various departments until I realized that I was actually just doing programming in all of them and was probably best off just majoring in Computer Science.</p>

<p>Volunteer in the <a href="https://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/visit/exhibits/animal_investigations/animal_discovery_room">Animal Discovery Room</a> at the Lawrence Hall of Science, where I introduce visitors to friendly critters like boa constrictors, turtles, and mice.</p>
