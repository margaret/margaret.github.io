  <div id="Sneks">
      <h3>Snek Stickers (Ongoing)</h3>
      <p>I drew a bunch of sneks. I use them like Facebook/Line stickers when I chat with people. Someday I'll make them into an iOS sticker pack.</p>
      <p>UPDATE: Submitting this to the app store soon. See a preview <a href={{ url_for('sneks') }}>here</a>.</p>

  <div id="Image Reizer">
      <h3>Content-Aware Image Resizing</h3>
      <p>Implementation of seam-carving algorithm by Avidan and Shamir.</p>
      <p><a href="http://github.com/margaret/seam-carver">On GitHub.</a></p>

  <div id="ISS">
      <h3>ISS Tracker</h3>
      <p>Basic Javascript and web dev refresher project. Made a simple version of <a href="http://isstracker.com">ISS Tracker</a> using the <a href="http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/">Open-Notify API.</a> Check it out <a href="http://margaretsy.com/ISS-tracker">here.</a> Or rather, you might, except I think the API I was using changed so it doesn't work anymore. It was a very much an exploratory project full of bad practices, but I learned a decent bit from it at the time.</p>
   </div>

  <div id="Datamuse">
    <h3>Datamuse</h3>
    <p>Spun up a quick Python wrapper for easier querying of the cool stuff over at OneLook's <a href="http://datamuse.com/api">Datamuse API</a> (reverse-dictionary, rhyme and near rhyme dictionaries, various word relationship lookups, autocomplete suggestions, etc). Find it and other related apps at <a href="http://datamuse.com/api/users.html">http://datamuse.com/api/users.html</a></p>
  </div>

  <div id="Animation">
    <h3>UCBUGG</h3>
    <p>I made an animated short in the Spring 2013 <a href="http://www.ucbugg.com/">UCBUGG</a> decal. I worked with Michael Ho, Nathan Connor, Stephanie Cai, <-- (major props to these three) Jin Kim, and Katherine Xu. I worked mostly on storyboarding and models. </p>
    <p>I highly recommend taking the class if you're interested in learning the full animation pipeline! Just make sure you have enough time for it because it's a lot of work.</p>

    <p>Created using the amazing and frustrating Autodesk Maya.</p>

  <div id="Prisoner's Dilemma">
    <h3>In which we learn that people are bad at predicting things</h3>
    <p>Once my friend ran an informal programmatic prisoner's dilemma <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hxy/prisoners_dilemma_tournament_results/">contest</a> with 21 participants. I won, I suspect not because of my brilliant program (here in its entirety: <code>(lambda (x) (if (<= (random 100) 80)'D 'C))</code>), but because predicting what other people will think is really hard. Admittedly this isn't really a project so much as a mildly amusing anecdote.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="Brainfuck">
    <h3>Brainfuck Interpreter</h3>
    <p>Once I procrastinated on my Compilers homework by writing a Brainfuck interpreter (in Python, which kind of negates the point of Brainfuck, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯). While Brainfuck is notoriously difficult to program in, it was actually pretty easy to implement, considering that there are only 8 commands. </p>

  <div id="Biology">
    <h3>Biology</h3>

      <h4>Bioinformatics</h4>
      <p>Wrote a good chunk of the pipeline for a a study on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/43/17409.full">the Neofunctionalization of young duplicate genes in Drosophila</a> in the <a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/bachtrog/">Bachtrog Lab</a> . It mostly involved <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/">regex</a> and plotting things. </p>

      <h4>Molecular Biology</h4>
      <p>Once upon a time, I was an Integrative Biology major, and decided that I should try benchwork to be more well-rounded. I worked in the <a href="http://online.sfsu.edu/stillmaj/">Stillman Lab</a> in Fall 2012, doing RNA purification for a project on the effect of increasing temperatures on insects in local streams. I followed a phenol-chloroform extraction protocol, which invovled a lot of micropipetting and cutting up flash-frozen caddisflies with tiny scissors and pureéing their body parts.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Circles">
    <h3>Circles</h3>
    <p>If you stare at the center of the demo long enough while hovering randomly over the circles quickly you can get some weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading">Troxler's fading</a> effects to happen. Made this way back when I first started poking around with jQuery, but what can I say, I still find it amusing. 
    If you like this sort of thing, also see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac_chaser">Lilac Chaser</a> illusion.</p>
