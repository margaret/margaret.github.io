<p>Here are some things I've worked on that didn't quite make the cut to be featured on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/margaretsy">LinkedIn</a></p>

<!--To do: Add table of contents. Might also consider just reorganizing site layout.-->

        <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
        <p>Wrote a good chunk of the pipeline for a a study on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/43/17409.full">the Neofunctionalization of young duplicate genes in Drosophila</a> in the Bachtrog Lab. It mostly involved <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/">regex</a> and plotting things. </p>

        <h3>Molecular Biology</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time, I was an Integrative Biology major, and decided that I should try benchwork to be more well-rounded. I worked in the Stillman Lab in Fall 2012, doing RNA purification for a project on the effect of increasing temperatures on insects in local streams. I followed a phenol-chloroform extraction protocol, which invovled a lot of micropipetting and cutting up flash-frozen caddisflies with tiny scissors and pure√©ing their body parts.</p>

          <h3>Brainfuck Interpreter</h3>
          <p>Once I procrastinated on my Compilers homework by writing a Brainfuck interpreter in Python. While Brainfuck is notoriously difficult to program in, it was actually pretty easy to implement, considering that there are only 8 commands. </p>
